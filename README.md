## Description

Push_swap is a project that aims to sort a stack of integers with the least number of operations possibl
e. It includes two programs:
- `push_swao` generates a sequence of opratios to sort the stack.
- `checker` verifies if a given sequence of operations sorts the stack correctly.

The goal is to implement efficient algorithms and undestand stack manipulation.

## Instructions

### Compilation
Run the following command in the project root: make

### Usage
To sort in a sequence of operations work: `./push_swap 3 2 1`
To check in a sequence operations works: `./push_swap 3 2 1 | ./checker 3 2 1`

## Resources

- 42 Push_swap subject PDF
- Tutorials and articles on sorting algorithms
- Helping some old students
- Track the program through gdb
- Track the program through a graphic emulator *visualizer*
- AI was used to help in correcting my misconceptions and give me the many tests
